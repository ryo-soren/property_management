<%#
  To create a form for a resource (i.e. a model), use
  the form_with helper instead of form_tag. Its usual
  arguments are:
  - A named argument 'model' which is assigned an
  instance of a model (i.e. a new question)
  -url will give the redirect path
  -method will post the http method for the form
  - A block that is passed the form object, where
   we build the HTML inside the form (i.e. labels,
   inputs, submission buttons, etc.)
    All data from the input fields a form built with this will have its name-value nested in a hash named
   after the class of the passed in model
   (e.g. <input type="text" name="question[title]" id="question_title"> => { "question": { "title": "What?"} })
%>  

<%= form_with(url: property_questions_path) do |form| %>
  <div>
    <%= form.label :question %>
    <br>
    <%= form.text_area :question, cols:50, rows: 5 %>
  </div>
  <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
